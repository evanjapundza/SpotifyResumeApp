# SpotifyResumeApp

This application is strictly my resume - but made to mimic the Spotify app! See all of my work experience, education, student involvement, skills, and more all within the familiar user interface.

It was created entirely in Swift using SwiftUI for the interface builder, and utilizes an MVVM design pattern.
